## Title: An Exploration of the NOAA Storm Database to Determine Health and Economic Effects of Severe Weather Events in the United States 

### Synopsis

```
"Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and 
economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can 
result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such 
outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern."  [course assignment page]

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database 
tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, 
including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, 
injuries, and property damage.

In this report the NOAA Storm Database is explored and an attempt is made to 
answer two basic questions about severe weather events:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the 
𝙴𝚅𝚃𝚈𝙿𝙴 variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2.  Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic 
consequences?

This report is in a "literate statistical programming" format with the intention 
of making the entire analysis readily reproducible. 

Possible audiences may include: government or municipal managers responsible for 
preparing for severe weather events who need to prioritize resources for 
different types of events, and fellow students of data science  who may find the 
methods of analysis and documentation of interest. 

DISCLAIMER: Please note that this report is for educational purposes only.  It 
does not make any determination or recommendation for any specific course of 
action or measure to be taken.  Further the report does not constitute an 
endorsement or validation of any of the data, methods, software, hardware, or 
results used or obtained herein.

## Data Processing

### Loading and Processing the Raw Data

First, data fom the NOAA storm database is downloaded from the course web site.  
The raw text is contained in a .bz2 compressed file.  The data fields are 
comma delimited.

```{r check_existence_file_repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2}
data_file <- paste0(file.path(".", "data", "repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2"))
if(!file.exists(data_file)) {
    file1Url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
    download.file(file1Url, destfile = "./data/repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", method = "curl")
    dateDownloaded <- date()
} else {
    cat('data file: [', data_file, '] was downloaded in a previous run \n')
    cat('on [', dateDownloaded, '] \n')
}
```

## Read the downloaded data into the variable storm.
```{r read storm data file}
# storm <- read.csv(bzfile("./data/repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2"))
```
The data contain 902,297 rows and 37 columns.
```{r dim_storm}
dim(storm)
```
The first ten rows are examined.
```{r head_storm}
head(storm, 10)

#str(storm)
#summary(storm)
```

## Results

There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.

You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
The analysis document must have at least one figure containing a plot.
Your analysis must have no more than three figures. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that 𝚎𝚌𝚑𝚘 = 𝚃𝚁𝚄𝙴 for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
